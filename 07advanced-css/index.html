        <h1>History of Gamer's Santuary</h1>
            
        <p>Video game enthusiast and founder of Gamer's Sanctuary, Wyatt Barlow believes that everyone should have an equal oppurtunity to enjoy video and board games "<strong>without having to break</strong>" your bank account. His very first video game console was a N64 which came with his all time favorite game, <a href="categories.html#categories">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. Today, games of this generation can run you to the bank begging for a loan, that is why he created Gamer's Santuary so that new and returning players can experience the love that he has for video/board games at an affordable price.</p>

            <h2>Reason's for price mark ups</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research shows that the upcoming consoles from Sony and Microsoft look much more historically competitive once inflation is taken into account (and once expected price drops are extrapolated).</li>
                    <li>In 1982, a copy of Activision's Tennis would run you $19.99 in Sears' holiday wishbook. That may sound like a bargain basement price, but it's actually equivalent to a moderate $48.18 in 2013 dollars.</li>
                    <li>As 1996 came around, prices started to fall back to historic norms somewhat, as retailers cleared out excess stock of increasingly outdated 16-bit games and got rid of cartridges for failed systems like the 32X and Jaguar.</li>
                </ul>
